"I think it is appropriate to decrease the wear and tear of the gates and improve access for delivery, service, and other vehicles."

"I would prefer 24/7, but if it saves money on repairs, maybe close them at 8pm and open in the morning?"
"I would recommend open from 7am to 10am and 4pm to 7pm."
"IF it would spare some wear and tear on the gates and mean that they'd break less often, we'd be in favor of having them open for the morning and evening rush hour. It might also alleviate some potentially dangerous back ups on Valley Falls."
